# Parent-Children2
Overview
This project is a simple voting application designed to allow users to vote for their favorite F1 driver from a given set of options. The app dynamically tracks and displays vote counts, providing a user-friendly way to engage in voting.

Originally envisioned as a parent-child management system, the project was refocused on a Formula 1-themed voting system where each "parent" represents a driver, and "children" represent the votes cast for that driver. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with local storage handling data persistence.

Features
Vote Casting: Users can vote for their preferred F1 driver with a single click.
Live Vote Count Updates: The vote tally updates dynamically without requiring a page refresh.
Data Persistence: Votes are stored using local storage, so counts remain intact even after refreshing the browser.
Responsive UI: Styled with Bootstrap for a clean and intuitive interface.
Simple and Lightweight: No backend is required; everything runs on the client-side.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the web page.
CSS3 & Bootstrap: Styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript (Vanilla): Handles voting logic and updates the UI.
Local Storage API: Saves vote counts across sessions.

Future Improvements
While the current version is functional, potential enhancements include:

Database Integration: Moving from local storage to a database for centralized vote tracking.
Authentication: Implementing user authentication to prevent multiple votes from the same user.
Real-Time Updates: Using WebSockets or Firebase to allow live vote tracking across multiple users.
Graphical Data Representation: Displaying votes in a bar chart or pie chart format for better visualization.
